    <h1>Flex Examples</h1>
    <h2>No Flex</h2>
    <div class="grabbable">
      <p>
        Try resizing the green rectangle by dragging the
        bottom right corner to the left.
      </p>
      <p>
        These three sections are stacked instead of side by
        side.
      </p>
      <p>No fair! I'm on the bottom!</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Default Flex</h2>
    <div class="flex grabbable">
      <p>
        Try resizing the green rectangle by dragging the
        bottom right corner to the left.
      </p>
      <p>
        You'll notice that the three sections will resize,
        with each one taking up more of the width based on
        how much text is in each box.
      </p>
      <p>No fair! I'm so small!</p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <h2>Each box will be evenly sized</h2>
    <div class="flex grabbable divy-evenly">
      <p>
        Try resizing the long green rectangle by dragging
        the bottom right corner to the left.
      </p>
      <p>
        You'll notice that now the three sections will all
        be the same size, regardless of how much text is in
        each box.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's much better! Although if you make us too
        small then you have to scroll left and right :(
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2>
      Each box will be evenly sized and wrap if too narrow
    </h2>
    <div class="flex grabbable divy-evenly wrap">
      <p>
        Try resizing the long green rectangle by dragging
        the bottom right corner to the left.
      </p>
      <p>
        You'll notice that now the three sections will be
        the same size and will wrap to the next line if they
        don't fit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yay! No more scrollbar. Although the text still gets
        really narrow and hard to read before it wraps.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2>
      Each box will be evenly sized and wrap if any box
      would be less than 100px wide without wrapping.
    </h2>
    <div class="flex grabbable divy-evenly wrap min-100">
      <p>
        Try resizing the long green rectangle by dragging
        the bottom right corner to the left.
      </p>
      <p>
        You'll notice that now the three sections will be
        the same size and will wrap to the next line if they
        don't fit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yay! Now the text doesn't get too narrow before it
        wraps.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2>Carousel with Horizontal Scroll Snapping</h2>
    <div class="flex grabbable divy-evenly min-250 snap-x">
      <p>
        Try resizing the long green rectangle by dragging
        the bottom right corner to the left.
      </p>
      <p>
        You'll notice that now the three sections will be
        the same size and will stay a minimum of 200px wide.
        If there is not enough space inside the parent div,
        then a horizontal scrollbar will appear.
      </p>
      <p>Yay! Now I'm in a carousel!</p>
    </div>
