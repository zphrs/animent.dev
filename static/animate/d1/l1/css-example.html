    Here's some text that will be dark red!
  </p>
  <p class="any-class-name asdf">
    Here's some more text that will be dark red because I
    can have unlimited elements which have the same class
    name! I also made this paragraph bold with the asdf
    class because one element can have unlimited classes as
    long as the class names are separated with spaces.
  </p>
  <p id="italicized">
    This is the only text which will be italicized because
    only one element is supposed to have any specific id.
    The id is supposed to itentify one specific element on
    your website.
  </p>
  <h1>
    All of the following headings, including this h1
    element, will be blue, because I listed out all the
    heading tags separated by commas in the style.css file.
  </h1>
  <h2>Blue h2</h2>
  <h3>Blue h3</h3>
  <h4>Blue h4</h4>
  <h5>blue h5</h5>
  <h6>Blue h6</h6>
